## 11 Express.js: Note Taker

This repository (Note Taker) is an educational homework assignment from the CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C course. It was designed to help students become more familiar with express and node.js. We were tasked with building an application that can take notes and save them to a json file on a server. The entire application is to be uploaded to the Heroku web sharing platform. This is a free website sharring platform that allows users to publish their finsished applications.

## User Story

```
AS A small business owner

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a note-taking application.
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```
## What I have learned
So far, the backend seems to come easier for me. I still use functions, but they seem to make more sense. The hard part for me anyway is still conceptualize a website. the functions make sense to me, its just the writing them that seems to be just out of reach. I like the back end because it feels like you are doing something. I like making the connections and adding the data to json.bd file, it is a good feeling when you can make a website function and deploy it. Although the front-end is coming to me slowly, the back end is much more enjoyable. This assignment I did not need any direction or help from anyone to get started, I was able to most of it on my own and asked for help when I ended up cosing myself into a wall.
