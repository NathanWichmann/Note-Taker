# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

This repository (Note Taker) is an educational homework assignment from the CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C course. It was designed to help students become more familiar with express and node.js. We were tasked with building an application that can take notes and save them to a json file on a server. The entire application is to be uploaded to the Heroku web sharing platform. This is a free website sharring platform that allows users to publish their finsished applications.
